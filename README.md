# Threads-and-bytes
Read the filenames from the console until the word "exit" is entered. Pass the filename to the ReadThread. The ReadThread thread must find the byte that occurs the maximum number of times in the file, and add it to the resultMap dictionary, where the String parameter is the filename and the Integer parameter is the byte to search for.
